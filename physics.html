    <h1>Physics</h1>
        <p> During my bachelor's degree I have had several courses in various
        areas of physics, however, these are the areas I have developed most interest in.</p>

    <h2> Computational Physics </h2>
        <p>My interest in computational physics developed after taking an elective course
        on machine learning. This course helped me develop moderate programming skills,
        and helped me reflect on the utility (necessity) of computers to model complex
        physical processes.</p>

        <p>Here is a link to the <a href="https://github.com/brunormzg/hello-world">GitHub repository</a> on my 
        computational physics coursework.</p>

            whose values were calculated using numerical integration.</p>

    <h2>Quantum Computing</h2>
        <p>Last semester I was introduced to quantum computing by one of my TA's. This semester
            I decided to take up an elective focused specially on this topic.</p>
        <p>I am currently learning <a href="https://qiskit.org/">Qiskit</a>, a Python-based
        computer languange developed by IBM to program quantum systems.</p>

    <h2>My Work</h2>
        <p>  Below you'll find some of my work from courses such as ordinary differential
        equations (ODE), optics laboratory, and electromagnetism laboratory.</p>
